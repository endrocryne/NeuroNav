# NeuroNav

A neurodivergent-friendly task management Progressive Web App (PWA) designed with privacy, accessibility, and adaptability at its core.

## Features

### Core Architecture & Platform
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on mobile and desktop devices with full offline functionality
- **Client-Side Storage**: All data stored locally using IndexedDB - no cloud backend or user accounts required
- **Material 3 Design**: Modern, accessible UI built with Google Material Design 3 components

### Core Functionality
- **AI-Powered Task Breakdown**: Input complex tasks (e.g., "plan vacation") and automatically generate actionable sub-tasks using client-side pattern matching
- **Personalized Routine Builder**: Create and save daily routines using natural language input (e.g., "Morning: wake up, make coffee, check email")
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations for tasks with completion tracking

### Adaptive User Experience
- **Energy-Based Planning**: Daily view adapts based on your current energy level
  - **Low Energy**: Shows only essential/survival tasks
  - **Medium Energy**: Shows survival tasks plus low-to-medium energy tasks
  - **High Energy**: Shows all tasks
  
- **Adaptive Interface Modes**:
  - **Linear Mode**: Traditional list view for sequential task management
  - **Mind Map Mode**: Visual, non-linear layout for brainstorming and viewing task relationships
  - **Low-Stimulus Mode**: Minimalist, low-contrast UI showing one task at a time to minimize overwhelm
  - **Gamified Mode**: Progress bars, points, streaks, and celebratory animations for motivation

### User-Centric & Privacy Features
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Supportive, non-judgmental language throughout the app
- **Encouraging Messages**: Optional motivational messages that rotate periodically
- **Privacy First**: Fully functional offline with no internet connection required
- **Data Portability**: Local data export/import for backups (JSON format)
