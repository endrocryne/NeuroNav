2. GRANT OF INSPECTION RIGHTS
Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, Agastya Mishra hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to inspect the Software solely for personal, educational, and reference purposes. This grant permits only the following activities:
You may read and view the source code of the Software using standard text editors, integrated development environments, or code viewing tools, provided that such viewing occurs in a manner that does not create persistent copies beyond those automatically and temporarily created in computer memory (RAM) during the viewing process.
You may take handwritten notes about the Software's design, architecture, and implementation approaches for Your own personal learning and reference, provided such notes do not reproduce substantial portions of the actual source code and are not shared with others.
You may mentally study and analyze the algorithms, data structures, design patterns, and programming techniques employed in the Software for the purpose of general software engineering education.
